Here is the input for the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm:
"Baker Betty Lou bought some butter. But, it made her batter bitter. So, Baker Betty Lou bought 
some better butter to make her bitter batter better."
You can either implement BPE in Python or use the pseudo code (from the textbook or the 
slides) and hand calculate the output. Run the BPE algorithm at least 7 times. That is k should be 
7 or more. 
Upload your code with output (Jupyter notebook is welcome) or your detailed hand calculations. 
Show the initial vocabulary and the vocabulary after each iteration. Show, proof that vocabulary 
addition is justified at each iteration.
BPE algorithm is given in slide52 in 2A_TextProc.pptx posted under Module 1 in Canvas. In the textbook 
it is in Section 2.4.3 on page 18.
